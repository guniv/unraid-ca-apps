## üí° What's new

   - The newsletter now adapts it self, to display the series addition in the most convenient way possible. 
- If more than 10 media are added, media overview (description) is skipped to avoid having a too long newsletter. #24

- 
## üß∞ What's fixed
- Fix #28. Depending on Jellyfin installation and/or pluggin, it is possible that some items are *virtually* added. The newsletter were considering those item as new, since they officially exist in jellyfin catalog. To avoid this odd behavior, virtual episodes or movies are now ignored.

- Fix #26 &amp; Fix #27 
   -  Due to a difference of definition of 1st day of week between usual/standard crontab and APScheduler, the use day_of_the_week in cron expression was buggy with an offset of 1 day (crontab starts week on sun, while APScheduler, used by the project starts day on mon).
