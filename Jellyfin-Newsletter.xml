## ‚ú® What's new
- You can now choose to ignore items that were aleady sent in previous newsletter. Add the parameter `jellyfin.ignore_item_added_before_last_newsletter: true` in your config file to enable this feature. *(See the [config-example.yml](https://github.com/SeaweedbrainCY/jellyfin-newsletter/blob/v0.8.0/config/config-example.yml) file for more information)*. Issue #38. PR #50 by @SeaweedbrainCY.
- You can now configure yourself the treshold used by the script to auto-hide summaries when too many items are in the newsletter (to gain place). You can also always disable/enable this feature. See the [config-example.yml](https://github.com/SeaweedbrainCY/jellyfin-newsletter/blob/v0.8.0/config/config-example.yml) file for more information. Issue #45. PR #51 by @SeaweedbrainCY.
- Current script version is now displayed in the debug logs.

## üß∞ What's fixed
- Some items metadata could collide due to a too light way to identify them. Items are now uniquely identified by their jellyfin id to avoid any collision. Issue #49. PR #52 by @SeaweedbrainCY.
- Metadata required by this script are more strongly enforce to avoid any error at runtime. Items that don't meet metadata requirements are ignored. Issue #47. Discussion #46. PR #52 by @SeaweedbrainCY.
- API calls to jellyfin have been optimized to not retrieve too much unused information.
